# CompanyDB

This is the code for a very simple website to display the data stored in a database we designed to solve a a conference structuring issue.

## Procedure

We initially designed a relational schema for the database and made some general assumptions in how the data was presented to avoid confusion.  Then we structured the database and built a simple website as shown in our code.

## Technologies

PHP, HTML and CSS were used.
